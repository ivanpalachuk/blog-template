title: "Navigating the Review Rapids: A Pro's Guide to Riding the Feedback Wave"
---

Today I want to talk about something we all know is lurking in the depths of hotel management but sometimes wish we could just ignore: online reviews. We've all been there—juggling a zillion tasks and then, bam, another review notification pops up. Those little digital shoutouts have become the new word-of-mouth and we must pay close attention to them.

Think about it! When was the last time you booked a stay without peeking at what others had to say? Guest reviews are like the GPS for potential customers; they help navigate them right to your front desk—or steer them away. Guest reviews have become so are always in the top 5 factors considered when making a reservation.

As you probably noticed, 90% of reviews come from guests either super satisfied and happy or really disappointed and even furious with your service.

# So…What is the best way to manage reviews?

The first step is to avoid negative reviews and encourage good ones! Yes, I know what you are thinking! but let me explain!

Sure, stuff happens. Room service might miss a beat, or the AC couldn’t have picked a worse time to take a break, but that doesn't necessarily mean a negative review, at least not online.

Before we continue let me tell you who are my favorite guests! I love the ones who make a beeline for the front desk to air their grievances. Why? Because that's your golden ticket to flip the script. Solve their problem, throw in a little extra for the trouble, and watch them transform from potential ranters to loyal customers. They might even become your mini-marketers, telling everyone how well you treated them and how you make them feel important and special.

Here's the kicker, though— most guests don’t complain! they simply never come back and might even leave a negative review. This is expensive! After putting in so much work to win someone over as a client, it's a double setback when you lose them and they leave a negative review that may deter others from bookings. So dealing with dissatisfied guests should be a priority!

But hey, it's the 21st century, and tech is our new best friend! Guest experience apps with real-time feedback are game-changers. Using the right tech, you can spot a guest's dissatisfaction and address it before it escalates into an online complaint.

Consider this scenario: a guest requests room service and the moment they signal for their tray to be removed, they receive a one or two-question satisfaction survey on their phone. If there’s any hint of dissatisfaction, you’re ready to respond immediately, resolving any concerns before they escalate. Of course, you can do this with any service or product you provide. Using a real-time feedback tool allows you to have a "Satisfaction thermometer" of your guest updated by the minute.

And let's not forget the power of QR codes. Stick them around and make it super easy for guests to report anything amiss. The faster you jump on it, the more they'll feel valued—and less inclined to vent online later.

Now, for those guests who are practically throwing rose petals at your feet, nudge them gently toward sharing the love online. A free cocktail or a cheeky discount on their next visit can work wonders. Trust me, it's worth it! Again, a good Guest Experience platform should automatize this process for you.

# But what if a bad review slips through the net?

Don't sweat it. Your response is your secret weapon. Keep it cool, stay respectful, and if they've got it wrong, stand your ground with grace. Everyone understands that some people are habitual complainers, so if it's just a one-off complaint and you address it effectively, it's likely to be overlooked.

Just remember, answering reviews should be taken seriously and is not newbie territory. You want consistency and savvy, so set some solid guidelines and keep that tone uniform. Offer a solution or compensation when possible and say sorry when you were in the wrong.

# Final words

Don’t dwell on each review too much! People will always complain! But remember reviews (internal or online) are a gold mine of guest data!

Analyze them and use this information to make data-driven decisions.

This is where technology can help you again, organizing and helping you pinpoint areas of strength and opportunities for improvement, enhancing your service and, ultimately, guest satisfaction.

So there you have it. Ride the review wave like a pro, and not only will you keep your guests coming back for more, but you'll also steer your ship toward that five-star horizon!
